# Relational_Database-Project

"The database architecture of the 'Hand to Hold' project is strategically designed following a robust 3-tier format. This approach effectively segregates the client layer from the backend processes, offering increased security, control, and scalability. Moreover, the conceptual layer collaborates seamlessly with the server, creating ample space for handling big data and analytics, ensuring a responsive and efficient workflow.

1. **Client Layer:**
   - Accessible to clients for filtering, chatting, and information retrieval at the front end.
   - Strict separation from backend processes for heightened security.
   - Access control management by administrators to regulate client access.

2. **AWS Cloud Hosting:**
   - Comprehensive hosting on AWS cloud for both back-end and front-end aspects.
   - Enables scalability, allowing flexibility for testing diverse parameters.
   - Implementation of data sharding to optimize workflow efficiency.

3. **Server Layer with MongoDB:**
   - Utilizes MongoDB for efficient data storage, offering advanced analytics through NoSQL.
   - Creates potential business opportunities through powerful search and interactive features.
   - Processes diverse data types, including images, videos, and links with social handles.

4. **Storage Requirements:**
   - Initial stage storage requirement set at 30 GB, extendable as per usage needs.

5. **Future Enhancements:**
   - Incorporation of Redis software to expand application features.
   - Planning for continued development and evolution to meet evolving user needs.

By adopting this layered architecture, we not only ensure the security and control of user activities but also pave the way for future scalability and feature expansions. The strategic hosting on AWS cloud, coupled with MongoDB's capabilities, positions the 'Hand to Hold' project for robust performance and adaptability in the dynamic landscape of data-driven applications."
